# Battle Kingdoms: Untold Legends
A simple text-based RPG written in Java which uses file syncing software to function.

## Play it!
If you want to play the game, here are the instructions:
1. Clone or download the repo.
2. Open the "builds" folder.
3. Open a command prompt or terminal and run the command: "java -jar <latest version>.jar"

## Work on it!
To develop the game, first make sure you have Java installed (which I'm sure you do).
Then, either fork it or create a pull request.
It is an Eclipse project, so just put it in your Eclipse workspace and you're good to go!
