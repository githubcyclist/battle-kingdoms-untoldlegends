Battle Kingdoms: Untold Legends

This game will be extremely complex and I need to think it through.

***WHEN THE GAME STARTS***

If this is the first time that the player has started the game, a folder called "local-config" will be created (if it doesn't already exist), and then this will be displayed:

~~~Battle Kingdoms: Untold Legends~~~
It looks like this is your first time playing.
Please enter the path to your file sync folder:

The game will then look for a directory called "battlekingdoms-data" in the given sync folder. If it doesn't exist, then the game will prompt the user:

Could not find a game data folder at that location. Would you like to create it? [y]es or [n]o

If the user says yes, then a game data folder will be created. Otherwise, the game will prompt the user again:

Please enter a path to a different file sync folder:

If the user says no again, then this will continue in an endless loop until the user either specifies a folder with a game data folder or agrees to create a new one.

If the user enters a sync folder without a game data folder, once an empty game data folder is created, this message will be displayed:

Congrats! You have just created an empty game data folder. This folder contains no servers. Would you like to create a new server? [y]es or [n]o

If the user says yes, then this prompt will be displayed:

What should the server be called?

After the server name has been entered, this message will be displayed:

Hooray! A new server, <server name>, has been created!

And then this one:

You need to set a display name to play on this server. Enter it here:

And then gameplay will start.

*    *    *

If the user has already gone through the setup process, then a server list will be displayed, e.g.:

~~~Battle Kingdoms: Untold Legends~~~
Welcome back, <display name>!
Servers:
1. First server
2. Second server
3. Third server

Choose one to play on by its number above:

Once the user has selected a server to play on, gameplay begins.

***GAMEPLAY***

~~When You Start Out~~

When the user first starts playing, they will be greeted with this screen:

Welcome! You start with:
500 Gold
A Level 1 Gold Mine to get more gold

~~Attacking - Beat Your Friends!~~

The key "a" opens the attack menu.
This is what the attack menu looks like:

~~ATTACK!!!~~
Users you can attack:
(all users on the server except you)

Fighters needed to attack: <amount of fighters>/3
If you don't have enough fighters to attack, it will say "Get more Fighters and try again" here.

If you do have enough fighters to attack, it will display this:

Choose a user to attack, or press <q> to quit: 

If the user presses q, then the program will exit the attack menu.
If not, then the program will validate if the given user exists.
If the user exists, then the program will create a file called "Warfile.tmp".
This file will contain your display name, and the target computer will recieve this notification:

<your display name> has declared war on you!




~~Alliances - Crush Your Enemies!~~

In the server console, the key "l" should be used to open the alliance menu.
It should look something like this:

~~Alliance Menu~~
You are allied with:
friendlybear13
All users on the server:
evilvillain45
friendlybear13
neutralfox63
extravagantduck89
<c> to create an alliance,
<r> to remove one (use sparingly!) and
<g> to give gold to allies
Type your command >
